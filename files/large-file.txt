INVESTIGATION 3: OTHER COMMANDS THAT USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
In this section, you will see how regular expressions can be used with other Linux utilities other than grep or egrep.


Perform the Following Steps:

Make certain that you are located in your home directory on your Matrix account.

Let's look at using regular expressions with the man command.
Issue the following linux command :
man ls

We want to search for an option that can sort the file listing.
Type the following regular expression below and press ENTER:
/sort

FYI: The grep and egrep linux commands contain the regular expressions within quotes,
but most other Linux commands specify regular expressions using forward slashes
(e.g. /regular expression   or   /regular expression).

Scroll throughout the man pages for the ls command to view matches for the pattern "sort"
(You can press SPACE or key combination alt-b to move forward and backwards one screen respectively).

Press the letter q to exit the man pages for ls.

Let's use regular expressions with the more command.
Issue the following linux command to view the contents of the textfile1.txt (downloaded in a previous section):
more textfile1.txt

We want to search for a pattern uli101 within this text file.
Type the following regular expression and press ENTER:
/uli101

What did you notice?

Search for the next occurrence of the pattern uli101 by re-typing
the following regular expression and pressing ENTER:
/uli101

you should now see the second occurrence of this pattern within the text file.

Press the letter q to exit the more command.

Try the same search techniques with the less command.

Does it work the same for the less command as it did for the more command?

Let's learn how to perform a simple search and replace within the vi utility by using regular expressions.
Issue the following linux command to edit the textfile1.txt file:
vi textfile1.txt

Let's first perform a simple search within this text file.

Type the following and press ENTER:
/uli101

You should move to the first occurrence of the pattern: uli101.

Let's search for the uli101 pattern, but replace it in capitals (i.e ULI101).

In vi, in order to perform and command, you need to go into last line mode, and then issue a command to apply to the entire text file, followed by a regular expression to search for and a regular expression to replace (i.e. /search/replace/).

Type the following and press ENTER:
:%s/uli101/ULI101

You should have noticed that the first occurrence of uli101 has been changed to ULI101.

Navigate throughout the text file to see if the other occurrences have been replaced.

You should notice they haven't for the other two occurrences. In order to replace for ALL occurrences,
you need to add the letter g (meaning "global") at the end of the last forward slash (e.g /search/replace/g).

Making certain that you are command mode in vi, type the following and press ENTER:
:%s/uli101/ULI101/g

Navigate throughout the text file to confirm that ALL occurrences of uli101 have been replaced with ULI101.

Save changes to your vi editing session and exit by typing the following and pressing ENTER:
:x
