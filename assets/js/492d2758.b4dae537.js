Any software application on the MyApps menu can be used on computers in classrooms, labs, and the Computing Commons.\n\nReference: <https://inside.senecacollege.ca/its/software/myapps/>\n\nYou will now use **MyApps** on your Windows workstation in your Seneca lab room to launch an application to allow you to connect and login to your Matrix server account.\n\n**Perform the Following Steps:**\n\n1.  Start your workstation in your lab and login to your Seneca Windows account.  \n      \n2.  Make certain that the **MyApps** window is open.

If you where located outside Seneca's network, then you would need to enter the full domain name: **matrix.senecac.on.ca**  \n\n8.  When connecting securely for the **first time**, a dialog box will appear to share a \"public key\" with your Matrix account in order to make your interaction between your workstation and the remote Linux server secure within the network (i.e. encrypted to prevent unauthorized access by other users).\n      \n    **FYI:** To make communications over a network secure, a computer generates **two keys**: a **private key** that is kept on the computer, and a **public key**, which can be shared with other computers. Transmissions from your computer uses the private key to encrypt (scramble) transmission to the remote computer, which in\n    turn, uses the public key to decrypt (unscramble) the transmission. Likewise, the remote computer uses the public key to encrypt (scramble) transmissions and your computer uses the private key to decrypt (unscramble) those transmissions.  \n\n9.  Click the **Yes** button to share your public key.  \n      \n10. Next, a dialog box will appear prompting you for your Matrix account password in order to gain entry to your Matrix account. Your Matrix password is identical to your Seneca password. As you type the password, the text will be blocked-out or hidden to prevent others from viewing the screen to obtain your password.\n      \n11. Enter your password and click **OK** or press **ENTER**  \n\n12. Click **OK** or press **ENTER** at the **Authentication Response** dialog box.  \n      \n    **NOTE:** If you encounter an **error message**, this can occur for several reasons:\n\n    1.  You mis-spelled the **name of the server**\n    2.  You mis-spelled your Matrix **username** (same username that you connect to my.senecacollege.ca)\n    3.  You have **CAPS LOCK** on by mistake (your username should be **lowercase** only).\n    4.  You mis-spelled your **password** (same password that you connect to my.senecacollege.ca)\n\n    If you continue to experience the same problems, click on the following link for IT service desk contact info: [**IT service desk**](https://students.senecacollege.ca/spaces/190/support/wiki/view/1473/contact-its).  \n      \n\n13. If you entered your password correctly, the main SSH Linux shell should appear where you enter Linux commands.  \n      \n    The **Matrix** server has been configured to allow users to **only interact with the Linux OS by issuing commands**. There are various reasons for this, but the main 2 reasons are to **force students to learn how to issue Linux commands** as well as **limitations to remote access to a graphical Linux server** due to large number of users (students).  \n      \n\nYou can **configure** the SSH application to adjust elements such as the **window size** and **text font type** and text **font size**. We will be showing you how to configure your SSH Secure Shell Client, but the other applications can allow you to configure their settings.  \n  \n**Perform the Following Steps:**\n\n1.  Click on the **Edit** menu item, and then select **Settings** in the Edit drop-down menu.  \n      \n2.  To change the size of your shell window, under the *Global Settings* section, click **Appearance**  \n      \n3.  Change the *window size* both horizontal and vertical to larger values.  \n      \n4.  To change the font size, under the *Global Settings* section, click **Font**  \n      \n5.  Select a larger *font size* and click **OK**  \n      \n6.  You now should notice that you have customized your SSH shell terminal.

In order to confirm that you successfully performed a tutorial, you will be required to run a program (or in later tutorials, several programs) to prove that you successfully completed tasks in a tutorial and get marks.\n\nThese programs (known as Shell Scripts) will check your work and offer feedback if you made mistakes, so you can make corrections.\n\nMaking corrections (i.e. troubleshooting) and re-running these checking programs until you are successful will help students gain "hands-on" experience as well as "trouble-shooting" experience.\n\nIf you have correctly completed the required tasks, the user can proceed. If the checking shell script detects an **error**, then it will provide feedback to allow the student to fix that problem so they can re-run the checking shell scripts until they have successfully completed a task.\n\n**Perform the Following Steps:**\n\n1.  Make certain that your current directory is **your home directory** by entering the following Linux command: ```bash\ncd\n')),(0,o.kt)("ol",{start:2},(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Issue the following command to run a checking script: ```bash\n","~","uli101/week1-check")),(0,o.kt)("pre",null,(0,o.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre"},'      \n    The beginning character "**\\~**" is called **tilde**.

Your screen should clear and indicate that you have proved that you have successfully logged in.  \n      \n4.  An email will be sent to your Seneca email as **confirmation** in case your ULI101 professor is assigning marks to these tutorials.  \n      \n    Keep those confirmation email messages for the duration of this semester as proof that you have completed those checking scripts in case there is a discrepancy in tutorial grades.      \n\n## LINUX PRACTICE QUESTIONS\n\nThe purpose of this section is to obtain **extra practice** to help with **quizzes**, your **midterm**, and your **final exam**.\n\nHere is a link to the MS Word Document of ALL of the questions displayed below but with extra room to answer on the document to simulate a quiz:\n\n<https://github.com/ULI101/labs/raw/main/uli101_week1_practice.docx>\n\nYour instructor may take-up these questions during class. It is up to the student to attend classes in order to obtain the answers to the following questions. Your instructor will NOT provide these answers in any other form (eg. e-mail, etc).\n\n**Review Questions:**\n\n1.  What is a \u201c**Linux Cluster**\u201d?
