## KEY CONCEPTS

**Data Representation**

Digital computers are **electronic devices** that contain a series of **circuits** and voltage levels that can store / represent data.

**Binary numbers** can represent those series of circuits with voltage levels.
Those binary numbers are combined in a sequence to form a **byte**. Bytes are used to represent numbers or characters.

![Binary Number 1](/img/Binary-number1.png)

IT professionals may need to perform **numbering conversion** to use with
_programming functions or OS commands to perform common operations on a computer system._

IT Professionals that Use Data Representation:

  - _Network Specialists:_ Building Large Networks via Sub-netting
  - _Programmers:_ Sending information over networks, files
  - _Web Developers:_ Setting color codes for webpage background or text
  - _Unix/Linux System Administrators:_ Setting _permissions_ for files and directories

**Numbering Conversion Methods**

**Method 1: Binary to Decimal**

When converting **binary** numbers to **decimal** numbers, perform the following steps:

  1. Write down the binary number.
  2. Starting from the **right-side**, draw **L**'s below the binary number moving to the left (refer to diagram below).
  3. Starting on the rightmost "**L**", multiply the value (placeholder) by **2** to the power of zero. 
  4. Continually repeat **step \#3** moving leftwards, increasing the power of _2_ by **1** (refer to diagram below).
  5. Add up the results to obtain the decimal value equivalent.

**NOTE:** To convert _octal_ and _hexadecimal_ numbers to **decimal**, replace the number **2**
(in red in the diagram below) with **8** (for octal) or **16** (for hexadecimal).

![Binary to Decimal](/img/Convert-bin-decimal.png)

**Method 2: Decimal to Binary**

When converting **decimal** numbers to **binary** numbers, perform the following steps:

  1. Write down the **decimal number** to be converted.
  2. On the right-side, write the number **1** and moving **leftwards**, keep doubling the numbers until that number is **greater than** the decimal number to be converted (refer to the diagram below).
  3. Starting on the left-side of those doubled numbers, compare that number with the decimal number. If that number if less than or equal to the decimal number, then write a 1 below and subtract that number from the decimal number to get a remainder. If the number is greater than decimal number (or remainder), then write a 0 below.

  4. Repeat **step \#3** (moving rightwards and comparing the number with the decimal's remainder)

**NOTE:** If you are converting to **8-bit**, **32-bit**, etc., add **leading zeros** if necessary.

![Decimal to Binary](/img/Decimal-to-bin.png)


**Method 3: Octal to Binary / Binary to Octal**

_Binary to Octal_

  1. **One octal number** represents **3 binary numbers**, so **starting from right-side**, group binary digits into **groups of 3** (add leading zeros if necessary).
  2. Write **(4)(2)(1)** under each **group of 3 binary numbers**.
  3. Multiply the value or "placeholder" (i.e. **0**'s and **1**'s) by the corresponding **(4)(2)(1)** for each group to obtain the octal number (refer to diagram of _binary_ to _octal_ conversion below).

![Binary to Octal](/img/Bin-to-octal.png)

_Octal to Binary_

  1. **One octal number** represents **3 binary numbers**, so space-out the octal numbers to make space for a binary number.
  2. Write **(4)(2)(1)** under each octal number.
  3. Write **0**'s or **1**'s for each group of binary numbers to add up to the corresponding octal number (refer to diagram of _octal_ to _binary_ conversion below).

![Octal to Binary](/img/Octal-to-bin.png)


**Method 4: Hexadecimal to Binary / Binary to Hexadecimal**

_Binary to Hexadecimal_

  1. **One hexadecimal number** represents **4 binary numbers**, so starting from right-side, group binary digits into **groups of 4** (add leading zeros if necessary).
  2. Write **(8)(4)(2)(1)** under each group of 4 binary numbers.
  3. Multiply the values or "placeholders" (i.e. **0**'s and **1**'s) by the corresponding (8)(4)(2)(1) for each group to obtain the octal number.
  4. Convert values from **10** to **15** to **A** to **F** (refer to diagram of binary to hexadecimal conversion below)

![Binary To Hexidecimal](/img/Bin-to-hex.png)

_Hexadecimal to Binary_

  1. **One hexadecimal number** represents **4 binary numbers**, so space-out the hexadecimal numbers to make space for a binary number.
  2. Convert letters **A** to **F** to **10** to **15** (refer to diagram of binary to hexadecimal conversion above)
  3. Write **(8)(4)(2)(1)** under each hexadecimal number.
  4. Write **0**'s or **1**'s for each group of binary numbers to add up to the corresponding hexadecimal number (refer to diagram of hexadecimal to binary conversion below).

![Hexidecimal to Binary](/img/Hex-to-bin.png)

**Method 5: Octal to Hexadecimal / Hexadecimal to Octal**

To convert using the method, simply use binary as a "**bridge**".

_Example:_

To convert octal to hexadecimal, convert octal to binary, then convert binary to hexadecimal.

To convert hexadecimal to octal, convert hexadecimal to binary, then convert binary to octal.

![Bridge](/img/Octal-hex.png)


**File Permissions**

Since Unix / Linux operating file systems allow for **multiple user accounts** it is essential to have a system to **share** or **limit** access to directories and files contained within the file system.

![Listing file directory](/img/Listing-file-directory.png)

Detailed directory listing showing permissions for a **directory** and a **regular file**.


When **directories** and **regular files** are created, they are assigned to an **owner** (typically the username which is the creator). To _allow_ or _limit_ **access** to those files and directories, those files and directories are assigned to an initial **group** referred to as a "**primary group**".

Users that own those directories and regular files are referred to as **users**, users that belong within the same group are referred to as same group members, and those users that do NOT belong to a particular group are referred to as **other group members**.

**NOTE:** In this course, we CANNOT create groups or assign users to groups in the **Matrix** server. Instead, you may learn how to those tasks when or if you take a Unix/Linux administration course. On the other hand, you can change which **user, same group members** or **other group members** can access or NOT access a directory or regular file.


File Permissions consist of **two-layers**:

**First**, the permissions of a **directory** that contains regular files, and **second**, permissions of the _subdirectories and/or regular files_ within that directory. Refer to the diagram below to see the explanation of permissions of a directory.

![Directory Permissions](/img/Directory-permissions.png)


Permissions for directories have a different meaning than permissions for **regular files**. Refer to the diagram below to see the explanation of permissions of a regular file.

![File Permissions](/img/File-permissions.png)


A symbol dash "-" indicates that the permission has **NOT** been granted.

The permissions of **newly-created** directories and regular files are automatically assigned via a **user mask** (we will discuss this shortly). In order to change permissions for directories and regular files, you would use the **chmod** command.


**Changing File Permissions with "chmod" command:**

***Symbolic Method:***

The chmod can use **symbols** to _add, remove,_ and _set_ **rwx** permissions for the **user**, **same group members**, and/or **other group members** for a directory or reqular file.

![Symbolic Chart](/img/Symbolic-chart.png)


***Octal (Absolute) Method:***

You can also use **octal numbers** to **set** permissions. This method is a short-cut and may require less typing than using the _symbolic_ method. You can only use this method to set file permissions (as opposed to _add_ or _remove_ permissions.

Since 1 octal digit represents 3 binary digits, one octal digit can represent the **rwx** permission granted or NOT granted. The permissions **rwx** are be in the form of 3 binary digits (1 represents the permission granted and 0 represents the permission NOT granted).

![Octal Permissions](/img/Octal-permissions.png)

**NOTE:** You can use the **-R** option to set permissions for directory, subdirectory and directory contents **recursively**.


**Setting Permissions for Newly-Created Directories and Regular Files (umask):**

The **umask** command is used to set the permissions of newly-created directories and regular files.


Issuing the **umask** command without arguments will display the current umask value. Refer to the diagrams below to set the umask value for directories and regular files. Setting the umask value (for example umask 022) only takes effect for the current shell session unless the umask command is contained in a start-up file (e.g. **.profile**, **.bash_profile**, or **.bashrc**).

## INVESTIGATION 1: NUMBERING CONVERSIONS

**ATTENTION:**

**This online tutorial will be required to be completed by Friday in week 5 by midnight to obtain a grade of 2% towards this cours**


For this investigation, we will NOT be logged into our Matrix account, but it is recommended to have an **MS Word document** open to manually perform numbering conversions.

**NOTE: It is essential that you learn how to manually perform numbering conversions since you will NOT be permitted to perform quizzes, midterm, or your final exam with a computer or a calculator. Learning to quickly perform manual numbering conversions will make IT professional more productive such as setting permissions, designing computer networks, or selecting complex colors when developing webpages.**

You will now get practice performing numbering conversions.

**Perform the Following Steps:**

  1. Let's convert the following binary number **10111110** to a **decimal number**.

**NOTE:** It is important to learn and **memorize** the **correct methods** to perform the
proper numbering conversion method (i.e. view **method 1** above (drawing the L's).

  2. Write the manual conversion either in your MS Word document.

  3. Use a **calculator** to check your work. In MS Windows, you can set the calculator to Programming mode
by making the selection to **binary**, enter the binary number **10111110** and view the decimal equivalent.

![Calc Check](/img/Calc-check.png)

Did you get the correct answer? If not, retry the method and check to see what you did wrong.

What method (displayed above) will you use? Use a calculator to check your work.

  12. When you have performed all of the numbering conversions above, then you can proceed to the next INVESTIGATION.


## INVESTIGATION 2: FILE PERMISSIONS

In this investigation, you will get experience using the **chmod** command to **change permissions** for existing files and the using **umask** command to automatically set permissions for newly-created files.


**Perform the Following Steps:**

  1. **Login** to your matrix account and issue a command to **confirm** you are located in your **home** directory.

  2. Issue a single Linux command to create the following directory structure displayed in the diagram below.

![File Permission Practice 1](/img/File-permission-practice-1.png)

**NOTE:** You will now run a shell script to confirm that you properly created that directory structure in your _Matrix_ account.

  3. Issue the following Linux command to run a checking script:

`~uli101/week4-check-1`

  4. If you encounter errors, make corrections and **re-run** the checking script until you receive a congratulations message, then you can proceed.

  5. Issue Linux commands to create **empty files** for each of those newly created **directories** as shown in diagram below:

![File Permission Practice 2](/img/File-permission-practice-2.png)

**NOTE:** You will now run another shell script to confirm that you properly created those empty files within those specified directories.

  6. Issue the following Linux command to run a checking script:

`~uli101/week4-check-2`

  7. If you encounter errors, make corrections and **re-run** the checking script until you
receive a congratulations message, then continue the remaining steps.

Let's get practice **viewing permissions**, **changing permissions**, and automatically **setting permissions for newly created files.**

  8. Issue the following Linux commands:

`ls -ld ~/documents ~/clients ~/vendors`

`ls -lR ~/documents ~/clients ~/vendors`

**NOTE:** You should see permissions already set for those newly created directories and regular files. What do these permissions mean for **same group member** and **other group member** access to those directory and regular files?

  9. Let's limit access to the **clients** and **vendors** directories to only yourself and same group members. Issue the following Linux command:

`chmod 750 ~/clients ~/vendors`

  10. Issue the **ls -ld** and **ls -lR** commands (as you did in step _\#8_) to confirm that the permissions for those directories have been changed.

**NOTE:** The **-R** option for the **chmod** command can change the file permissions recursively within a directory structure.

  11. Issue the following Linux command: `chmod 750 -R ~/documents`

  12. Issue the **ls -ld** command to confirm the permissions for the **~/documents**, **~/document/memos** , **~/documents/reports**, and **~/documents/contracts** directories.

  13. Issue the following Linux command: `ls -lR ~/documents`

What do you noticed happened to the permissions for the regular files contained in those directories. Did those regular file permissions change?

We will now change permissions for regular text file contained in subdirectories of the **documents** directory to: **r w - r - - - - -**

  14. Issue the following Linux commands:

`chmod 640 ~/documents/memos/memo*.txt`

`chmod 640 ~/documents/reports/report*.txt`

`chmod 640 ~/documents/contracts/contract*.txt`

  15. Issue the **ls -lR** command for the **~/documents** directory to confirm that those regular file permission have changed.

Let's run a checking script to make certain you correctly set permissions for those directories and files.

  16. Issue the following: `~uli101/week4-check-3`

  17. If you encounter errors, make corrections and then re-run the checking script until you receive a congratulations message
and then continue with this tutorial.

Let's get some practice setting permissions to allow users to make editing changes to regular files.

  18. Issue the following Linux command: `chmod ugo-w ~/documents/memos/memo*.txt`

  19. Use the **ls** command to verify that those regular file's permissions have changed.

  20. Using the nano or vi text editor, open the regular file **~/documents/memos/memo1.txt** and type in some text and try to save your editing changes.

What happened?

  21. To **abort** your editing session in **vi**: type `:q!` and press **ENTER**.

To **abort** your editing changes in **nano**: type `ctrl-x`

type `n` and then press **ENTER** when prompted to save editing changes.

  22. Issue the following Linux command to add write permissions for all files in the **memos** directory for yourself (i.e. user): 

`chmod u+w ~/documents/memos/*`

  23. Repeat steps to edit the file **~/documents/memos/memo1.txt** (as you did in _step \#20_).

Were you able to edit the file and save your editing changes?

  24. Issue a Linux command to view the contents of the **~/documents/memos/memo1.txt** text file that you were able to edit.

  25. Issue the following Linux command to view permissions for your **home** directory: `ls -ld ~`

What does execute permissions mean for same group members and other group members
in terms of your **home** directory?

  26. Issue the following Linux command to create a new subdirectory: `mkdir ~/shared`

  27. Issue the following Linux command: `ls -ld ~/shared`

What are the permissions for this newly-created directory?

Can other users access the directory pathname **~youruserid/shared** ?

  28. Issue the following Linux command (without an argument): `umask`

**NOTE:** You should see a **four-digit octal** number. Drop the leading zero on the left to obtain the **default umask value**.

  29. Perform a **mathematical calculation** by taking the **octal number 777** and **subtracting** the default umask value you determined in the previous step. What is the result?

  30. Convert that octal number result to a **binary number**. What does that represent as newly created directory permissions?
Does that correspond to the permissions for the newly created **~/shared** directory?

  31. Repeat the calculation (like in step \#28) but with a umask setting of **077** to see how this new umask setting would
affect permissions of newly-created directories.

  32. Issue the following Linux command: `umask 077`

  33. Issue the following Linux command (without arguments): `umask`

**NOTE:** You should notice the value **0077**. By dropping the leading zero to the left,
that would provide the default **umask value of 077**.

  34. Issue the following Linux command: `mkdir ~/shared2`

  35. Issue the following Linux command: `ls -ld ~/shared2`

Do the permissions for this newly created directory match the predicted permissions that you calculated in **step \#30**?

  36. Issue the following Linux command to create an empty regular file called **myfile.txt** in the **~/shared2** directory:

`touch ~/shared2/myfile.txt`

  37. Use the **ls -l** command to view the permissions for this newly created regular file.

What do you notice about those permissions?

Let's run a checking script to make certain you correctly set permissions for those recently-created directories and files.

  38. Issue the following: `~uli101/week4-check-4`

If you encounter errors, make corrections and then re-run the checking script until you receive a congratulations message
and then continue with this tutorial.

  39. Logout of your Matrix account, and then log-back into your Matrix account.

  40. Issue the following Linux command (without arguments): `umask`

What happened? Referring to your notes, what do you need to do to make that umask value persistent?

**WARNING:**

You should be extremely aware of your permissions since you may perform **marked work** for other courses on your **Matrix** server.

You should NOT set permissions to share your work with **same group** or **other** group members (unless **given specific permissions instructions from your course professors**). If students can have access to your directories and project files, they could **copy** your work and thus make yourself and other student(s) that copied your work to be charged with **academic dishonesty**.
