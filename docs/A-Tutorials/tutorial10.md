## Key Concepts

**Using the sed Utility**

**Usage:**

`Syntax: sed [-n] 'address instruction' filename`

**How it Works:**

  - The sed command reads all lines in the input file and will be exposed to the expression (i.e. area contained within quotes) one line at a time.
  - The expression can be within single quotes or double quotes.
  - The expression contains an address (match condition) and an instruction (operation).
  - If the line matches the address, then it will perform the instruction.
  - Lines will display be default unless the **–n** option is used to suppress default display

**Address:**

  - Can use a line number, to select a specific line (for example: **5**)
  - Can specify a range of line numbers (for example: **5,7**)
  - Regular expressions are contained within forward slashes (e.g. /regular-expression/)
  - Can specify a regular expression to select all lines that match a pattern (e.g **/^\[0-9\].\*\[0-9\]\$/**)
  - If NO address is present, the instruction will apply to ALL lines

**Instruction:**

  - **Action** to take for matched line(s)
  - Refer to table below for list of some **common instructions** and their purpose

| **Instruction** | **Purpose** |
| :---: | :--- |
| **p** | print line(s) that match the address (usually used with **-n** option) |
| **d** | delete line(s) that match the address |
| **q** | quit processing at the first line that matches the address |
| **s** | substitute text to replace a matched regular expression, similar to vi substitution |


**Using the awk Utility**

**Usage:**

`awk [-F] 'selection-criteria {action}’ file-name`

**How It Works:**

  - The **awk** command reads all lines in the input file and will be exposed to the expression (contained within quotes) for processing.
  - The **expression** (contained in quotes) represents **selection criteria**, and **action** to execute contained within braces **{}**
  - if selection criteria is matched, then action (between braces) is executed.
  - The **–F** option can be used to specify the default **field delimiter** (separator) character eg. **awk –F”;”** (would indicate a semi-colon delimited input file).

**Selection Criteria**

  - You can use a regular expression, enclosed within slashes, as a pattern. For example: **/pattern/**
  - The **~** operator tests whether a field or variable matches a regular expression. For example: **$1 ~ /^\[0-9\]/**
  - The **!~** operator tests for no match. For example: **$2 !~ /line/**
  - You can perform both numeric and string comparisons using relational operators ( **>** , **>=** , **<** , **<=** , **==** , **!=** ).
  - You can combine any of the patterns using the Boolean operators **\|\|** (OR) and **&&** (AND).
  - You can use built-in variables (like NR or "record number" representing line number) with comparison operators. For example: **NR >=1 && NR <= 5**

**Action (execution):**

  - Action to be executed is contained within braces **{}**
  - The **print** command can be used to display text (fields).
  - You can use parameters which represent fields within records (lines) within the expression of the awk utility.
  - The parameter **$0** represents all of the fields contained in the record (line).
  - The parameters **$1**, **$2**, **$3** … **$9** represent the first, second and third to the 9th fields contained within the record.
  - Parameters greater than nine requires the value of the parameter to be placed within braces (for example: **${10}**,**${11}**,**${12}**, etc.)
  - You can use built-in **variables** (such as **NR** or "record number" representing line number) eg. **{print NR,$0}** (will print record number, then entire record).

## INVESTIGATION 1: Using The SED Utility

**ATTENTION:**

**This online tutorial will be required to be completed by Friday in week 11 by midnight to obtain a grade of 2% towards this course**


In this investigation, you will learn how to manipulate text using the **sed** utility.

**Perform the Following Steps:**

  1. **Login** to your matrix account and confirm you are located in your **home** directory.

  2. Issue a Linux command to create a directory called **sed**

  3. Issue a Linux command to change to the **sed** directory and confirm that you are located in the **sed** directory.

  4. Issue the following Linux command to copy the data.txt file (**copy and paste** to save time):

`cp ~uli101/tutorialfiles/data.txt ~/`

  5. Issue the **more** command to quickly view the contents of the **data.txt** file. When finished, exit the more command by pressing the letter `q`

The **p** instruction with the **sed** command is used to
**print** (i.e. _display_) the contents of a text file.

  6. Issue the following Linux command:

`sed 'p' data.txt`

**NOTE: You should notice that each line appears twice.**

![Sed 1](/img/Sed-1.png)

The reason why standard output appears twice is that the sed command
(without the **-n** option) displays all lines regardless of an address used.

We will use **pipeline commands** to both display stdout to the screen and save to files
for confirmation of running these pipeline commands when run a **checking-script** later in this investigation.

  7. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed -n 'p' data.txt | tee sed-1.txt`

What do you notice? You should see only one line.

You can specify an **address** to display lines using the sed utility
(eg. _line \#_, **line \#s** or range of **line \#s**).

  8. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed -n '1 p' data.txt | tee sed-2.txt`

You should see the first line of the text file displayed.
What other command is used to only display the first line in a file?

  9. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed -n '2,5 p' data.txt | tee sed-3.txt`

What is displayed? How would you modify the sed command to display the line range 10 to 50?

![Sed 2](/img/Sed-2.png)

Using the sed command to display a range of lines. ^

The **s** instruction is used to **substitute** text
(a similar to method was demonstrated in the vi editor in tutorial 9).

  10. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed '2,5 s/TUTORIAL/LESSON/g' data.txt | tee sed-4.txt | more`

What do you notice? View the original contents of lines 2 to 5 in the **data.txt** file
in another shell to confirm that the substitution occurred.

The **q** instruction terminates or **quits** the execution of the sed utility as soon as it is read in a particular line or matching pattern.

  11. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed '11 q' data.txt | tee sed-5.txt`

What did you notice? How many lines were displayed
before the sed command exited?

![Sed 3](/img/Sed-3.png)

You can use **regular expressions** to select lines that match a pattern. In fact,
the sed command was one of the first Linux commands that used regular expression.

The rules remain the same for using regular expressions as demonstrated in **tutorial 9**
except the regular expression must be contained within **forward slashes** (eg. **/regexp/** ).

  12. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed -n '/^The/ p' data.txt | tee sed-6.txt`

What do you notice?

![Sed 4](/img/Sed-4.png)

Using the sed command using regular expressions with **anchors**.

  13. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`sed -n '/d$/ p' data.txt | tee sed-7.txt`

What do you notice?

![Sed 4](/img/Sed-4.png)

Using the sed command using regular expressions with **anchors**.

The **sed** utility can also be used as a **filter** to manipulate text that
was generated from Linux commands.

  14. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`who | sed -n '/^[a-m]/ p' | tee sed-8.txt | more`

What did you notice?

  15. Issue the following Linux pipeline command:

`ls | sed -n '/txt$/ p' | tee sed-9.txt`

What did you notice?

![Sed 5](/img/Sed-5.png)

  16. Issue the following to run a checking script:

`~uli101/week10-check-1`

If you encounter errors, make corrections and **re-run** the checking script
until you receive a congratulations message, then you can proceed.


In the next investigation, you will learn how to manipulate text using the **awk** utility.

## INVESTIGATION 2: Using The AWK Utility

In this investigation, you will learn how to use the awk utility to manipulate text and generate reports.

**Perform the Following Steps:**

  1. Change to your **home** directory and issue a command to **confirm** you are located in your _home_ directory.
  2. Issue a Linux command to create a directory called **awk**
  3. Issue a Linux command to change to the **awk** directory and confirm you are located in the **awk** directory.

Let's download a database file that contains information regarding classic cars.

  4. Issue the following linux command:

`cp ~uli101/tutorialfiles/cars.txt ~/`

  5. Issue the **cat** command to quickly view the contents of the **cars.txt** file.

The "**print**" action (command) is the default action of awk to print all selected lines that match a **pattern**.

This **action** (contained in braces) can provide more options
such as printing **specific fields** of selected lines (or records) from a database.

  6. Issue the following linux command all to display all lines (i.e. records) in the **cars.txt** database that matches the pattern (or "make") called **ford**:

`awk '/ford/ {print}' cars.txt`

![Awk 1](/img/Awk-1.png)

We will use **pipeline commands** to both display stdout to the screen and save to files for confirmation of running these pipeline commands when run a **checking-script** later in this investigation.

  7. Issue the following linux pipeline command all to display records in the **cars.txt** database that contain the pattern (i.e. make) **ford**:

`awk '/ford/' cars.txt | tee awk-1.txt`

What do you notice? You should notice ALL lines displayed without using **search criteria**.

You can use _builtin_ **variables** with the **print** command for further processing.
We will discuss the following variables in this tutorial:

**$0** - Current record (entire line)

**$1** - First field in record

**$n** - nth field in record

**NR** - Record Number (order in database)

**NF** - Number of fields in current record


For a listing of more variables, please consult your course notes.

  8. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display the **model, year, quantity** and price
in the **cars.txt** database for makes of **chevy**:

`awk '/chevy/ {print $2,$3,$4,$5}' cars.txt | tee awk-2.txt`

Notice that a **space** is the delimiter for the fields that appear as standard output.

The **tilde character ~** is used to search for a pattern or display standard output for a particular field.

![Awk 2](/img/Awk-2.png)

  9. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display all **plymouths** (**plym**)
by **model name, price** and **quantity**:

`awk '$1 ~ /plym/ {print $2,$3,$4,$5}' cars.txt | tee awk-3.txt`

You can also use **comparison operators** to specify conditions for processing with matched patterns
when using the awk command. Since they are used WITHIN the awk expression,
they are not confused with redirection symbols

**\<**     Less than

**\<=**   Less than or equal

**\>**     Greater than

**\>=**   Greater than or equal

**==**   Equal

**!=**   Not equal


  10. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display display the **car make, model, quantity** and **price** of all vehicles whose **prices are less than \$5,000**:

`awk '$5 < 5000 {print $1,$2,$4,$5}' cars.txt | tee awk-4.txt`

What do you notice?

![Awk 3](/img/Awk-3.png)

  11. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display display **price, quantity, model** and **car make** of vehicles whose **prices are less than $5,000**:

`awk '$5 < 5000 {print $5,$4,$2,$1}' cars.txt | tee awk-5.txt`

  12. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display the **car make, year** and **quantity** of cars that **begin** with the **letter 'f'**:

`awk '$1 ~ /^f/ {print $1,$2,$4}' cars.txt | tee awk-6.txt`

Combined pattern searches can be made by using **compound operator** symbols:

**\&\&**     (and)

**\|\|**        (or)

  13. Issue the following linux pipeline command to list all **fords**
whose **price is greater than $10,000**:

`awk '$1 ~ /ford/ && $5 > 10000 {print $0}' cars.txt | tee awk-7.txt`

![Awk 4](/img/Awk-4.png)

  14. Issue the following linux command:

`cp ~uli101/tutorialfiles/cars2.txt ~/`

  15. Issue the **cat** command to quickly view the contents of the **cars2.txt** file.

  16. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display the **year** and **quantity** of cars that **begin** with the **letter 'f'** for the **cars2.txt** database:

`awk '$1 ~ /^f/ {print $2,$4}' cars2.txt | tee awk-8.txt`

What did you notice?

The problem is that the **cars2.txt** database separates each field by a semi-colon (**;**) instead of **TAB**.
Therefore, it does not recognize the second and fourth fields.

You need to issue awk with the -F option to indicate that this file's fields are separated (delimited) by a semi-colorn.

  17. Issue the following linux pipeline command to display the **year** and **quantity** of cars that **begin** with the **letter 'f'** for the **cars2.txt** database:

`awk -F";" '$1 ~ /^f/ {print $2,$4}' cars2.txt | tee awk-9.txt`

What did you notice this time?

  18. Issue the following to run a checking script:

`~uli101/week10-check-2`

If you encounter errors, make corrections and **re-run** the checking script until you
receive a congratulations message, then you can proceed.
