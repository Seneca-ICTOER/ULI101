### What This Course is About

Unix and Linux represent the operating system technology underlying many of the services of the Internet. This subject introduces students to Unix, Linux and the Internet.

Students will learn the core utilities to work productively in a Linux environment. Students will accomplish this by using the shell (i.e. command prompt), learn to configure their login accounts, manipulate data stored in files, effectively use Linux commands and utilities, and write simple shell scripts to automate simple tasks.

### Accessing Your Linux Computer Account

You will need a **Matrix** account to complete and submit the ULI101 Weekly Tutorials and the Review Tutorials. If you have never logged into Matrix before, check your [MySeneca email](https://myseneca.ca/) for confirmation that your Matrix account was automatically created after you registered for ULI101. This should happen automatically if you are a new Seneca student and this is your first semester.
